# TerribleCraft

NOTE: I decided to abandon this project because I wasn't happy with the code. I will be trying this "Minecraft clone" game idea again, hopefully with better code.
That being said, parts of this game engine will be reincorporated into other ones :)

My very first Voxel game (Minecraft clone) made entirely in C++!

Work in progress at the moment. Check the [TODO](TODO) file to see what's left!
