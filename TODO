Full TODO List:
- Spilt up rendering entirely into seperate files
- Rewrite/reorganize the code to be cleaner
x Split header files into source files when needed
- Make a texture atlas and create a function that can find the texture coordinates for a texture
- Make a block class that represents a single block with a few properties, including a pointer to the parent chunk that owns the block
- Make a chunk class that stores blocks in a 16 * 16 * 256 area (just like Minecraft)
- Optimize chunks to not render invisible block faces
- Lighting
- Biomes
- Map generation (with an optional seed)
- An UI system
- Main menu and pause menu
- Come up with a title no one has came up with before (possible ideas: EmreTechCraft, TechCraft)

Current bugs:
x Controlling the camera with the mouse is slightly broken
- Textures might be rotated on the side faces
